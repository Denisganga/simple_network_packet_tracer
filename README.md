# Simple Network Packet Tracer Project

Welcome to the Simple Network Packet Tracer project! This project i made it for fun, i just like tech. This is a home network integrated with Internet of Things (IoT) devices. You can control various aspects of your home, such as lighting turn on or off the home lights, locking the door or openning it, fan speed either low,medium or high, window status i.e opening or closing, and more, all from a tablet interface.

## Overview

This Packet Tracer project aims to showcase a basic home network setup with IoT functionalities. By downloading and opening the project file using Cisco Packet Tracer, you can explore and interact with the simulated network.

## Features

- **Light Control:** Turn lights on or off in different rooms.
- **Door Access:** Open or close the door securely using the IoT system.
- **Fan Speed Adjustment:** Adjust the fan speed to high or low based on your comfort.
- **Window Status:** Open or close windows as needed.
- **Tablet Interface:** Use a tablet to conveniently control all IoT devices in your home.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Simple Network Packet Tracer project:

1. **Download:** Clone or download the project files from the GitHub repository.
2. **Open with Packet Tracer:** Launch Cisco Packet Tracer and open the project file (`simple_network_packet_tracer.pkt`).

## Network Topology

The project includes a simple home network setup with routers, switches, and various IoT devices connected to illustrate a practical home automation scenario.

## Usage

1. **Explore the Network:** Take a tour of the simulated home network to understand the device placements.
2. **Interact with IoT Devices:** Use the tablet interface to control lights, door, fan, windows, and other IoT-enabled devices.
3. **Experiment:** Feel free to experiment with different scenarios and observe how the network responds to changes.

## How to Control IoT Devices

This is how you can control the functionalities of the IoT devices using the tablet:
- Click on the tablet.
- Under the desktop section, choose IoT monitor.
- In the IoT monitor, you will be redirected to the login page. Use IP address 192.168.1.10 with the username and password as 'admin'.
- Perform all the functionalities of the IoT using this interface.

## Note

- This project is designed for educational purposes and aims to demonstrate basic networking and IoT concepts.
- For an optimal experience, use Cisco Packet Tracer to open and interact with the project.
